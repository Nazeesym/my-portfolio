		<h1>Clifford's Diary<h1>
			<h2><strong><em>STORYTIME!!!</em></strong></h2>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p><strong><em>Cliford</em></strong> is a strong man. He hails from Aboh Mbaise in Imo state.
			He is the last born of his parents out of family of 5.<br>
			His parents are late so he survived by struggling and he succeeded in training himself through school and finally became a teacher.<br>
			It wasn't an easy task for him to do but he made sure he accomplished his quest not withstanding the challenges of life.<br>
			He married a beautiful woman called Beatrice who hails from Obike in Ngor Okpala in the same Imo state.<br>
		God being so wonderful blessed them both with 5 children (3Boys and 2 Girls).<br>
		<strong><em>The following are list of their Children.</em></strong></p>

		<li>Chibuike</li>
		<li>Chibueze</li>
		<li>Chinemerem</li>
		<li>Chinonyerem</li>
		<li>Chinazaekpere</li>

	<p2>Wondered less, the aim is for all to be successful and behold its a journey all 5 must attain to at least make Mr.Clifford and Beatrice eat the fruit of their labour.</p2>
	<p3><h3><strong>How do they attain this quest to accomplishment?</strong></h3></p3><br>
	<p4>Believe me this is an important question that needs an answer and to answer the question one needs great wisdom. Forget you not that unity binds souls together and together multitudes conquer, so in summary, <strong>Unity</Strong> answers the unforgettable question.<br>
	Distractions might come in form of disagreement, be you wise to know these symptoms when it comes wavy. Because only a rugged sailor can attest to what the eyes saw in the lounge of struggle during a rough wagged sail in the ocean.</p4>
